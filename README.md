# Hyperlink Dashboard

This VS Code extension replaces the empty editor watermark with a simple interactive dashboard. When no editors are open (or when no workspace is open at startup), the dashboard appears.

Usage
- Run the `Show Hyperlink Dashboard` command to open it manually.
- It will automatically appear when all editors are closed.

Development
- Open this folder in VS Code and press `F5` to run the extension in the Extension Development Host.
